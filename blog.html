            <h3>What is difference between .map(), .forEach() and filter, find?</h3>
            <div>

                <p>
                    <span>.map():</span>
                    .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                    elements.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>.forEach:</span>
                    .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the
                    array and it returns undefined.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>.filter():</span>
                    .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new
                    array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span>.find():</span>
                    The find() method returns the first value that matches from the collection. Once it matches the
                    value in findings, it will not check the remaining values in the array collection.

            <h3>What is Event Loop? How to it works?</h3>
            <p>
                The event loop allows Node. js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript
                is single-threaded. It is done by assigning operations to the operating system whenever and wherever
                possible. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming.

            <h3>What is difference between localStorage,SessionStorage and Cookies?</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript provides three mechanisms for storing data on the client âˆ’ cookies, session storage, and
                local storage. Each one has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

            <div>
                <span> Local storage </span> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be
                stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data
                that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
            </div>

            <div>
                <span>Session storage</span> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session.
                This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for
                storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
            </div>

            <div>
                <span>Cookies</span> are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well
                supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is
                not sensitive, such as user preferences.
